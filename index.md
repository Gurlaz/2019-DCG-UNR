Welcome to SETAC-NA 2018 RNAseq workshop!
===

This website contains materials for the [mRNAseq Data Workshop: De Novo Assembly and Differential Expression Analysis](https://sacramento.setac.org/scientific-program/abstract-submission/trainingcourses/) full-day course (8:00 am-5:00pm), held on 4 November, 2018 at the [SETAC North America](https://sacramento.setac.org/) meeting, at the [Sacramento Convention Center in room CC-311](https://sacramento.setac.org/venue/).

We are very excited to have you here and hope that we can get through a lot of material today!

This workshop runs under a [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.html). Please respect it and be excellent to each other!

This workshop incorporates materials from the [Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing or ANGUS](https://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2018/). We recommend you visit and explore these materials! ANGUS materials are taught at the [Data Intensive Biology Summer Institute or DIBSI](http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/) coordinated at UC Davis every summer by [Dr. Titus Brown](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab), which Lisa, Jane and Elias assist with in their capacity as certified [Carpentry Instructors](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/09/merger.html).
