Welcome to SETAC-NA 2018 RNAseq workshop!
===

We are very excited to have you here and hope that we can get through a lot of material today!

## Instructors

* [Lisa Johnson](https://ljcohen.github.io/)

This workshop incorporates materials from the [Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing or ANGUS](https://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2018/). We recommend you visit and explore these materials! The ANGUS materials are taught at the [DData Intensive Biology Summer Institute or DIBSI](http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/) coordinated at UC Davis every summer by [Dr. Titus Brown](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab), which Lisa, Jane and Elias assist with in their capacity as certified [Carpentry Instructors](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/09/merger.html).
